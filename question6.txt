String interpolation and concatenation are both methods used to combine strings in programming.

1.String Interpolation:
   String interpolation is a method of constructing a new string that includes the 
   values of variables within the string itself. In many programming languages, this 
   is achieved by embedding variables or expressions within a string literal using special 
   syntax. The language evaluates these expressions and inserts their values into the resulting string.

   Example 
   const name = "mayur";
   const age = 16;
   const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
   console.log(greeting);   

2.String Concatenation :
   String concatenation is a method of combining strings by appending one string to the end of another.
   This can be achieved using operators like `+` in many programming languages.

   Example 
   const firstName = "Mayur";
   const lastName = "Naik";
   const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
   console.log(fullName);   

   string interpolation allows for embedding expressions directly within a string using placeholders
while string concatenation involves joining strings together using operators or functions.
Both methods serve the purpose of creating composite strings from multiple substrings or variables.
